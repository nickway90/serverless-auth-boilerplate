# serverless-auth-boilerplate
Serverless backend in AWS Lambda with basic Auth features. Using serverless-async-await to support async await syntax, and serverless-plugin-warmup to prevent cold start issue.

I am using my own fork of serverless-async-await as it has conflict with serverless-plugin-warmup.
